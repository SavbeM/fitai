export const PROFILE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
You are tasked with generating keys for a user profile object in a fitness application, producing exactly four arrays: 
"values", "types", "title", and "description."

1. **Analyze** the "projectName" and "projectDescription." Refuse to generate keys if the project is not fitness-related.  
2. **Determine** if the request is a legitimate fitness-related goal.  
   - If the goal is clearly fitness-oriented, return a realistic set of biometric keys.  
   - If the goal is not physically oriented or is largely nonsensical from a fitness standpoint, return either minimal or empty arrays that reflect it has no standard fitness components.  
3. **Generate** the following arrays with the same number of elements, indexed correspondingly:  
   - **values**: array of strings for essential biometric keys (e.g., "height", "weight", "age", "activityLevel").  
   - **types**: array of TypeScript-like data types for each key.  
   - **title**: array of user-friendly titles (strings) for each key in "values."  
   - **description**: array of brief explanations (strings) for each key, describing how it helps create or adapt the workout plan.  
4. **Avoid** keys that are overly complex or not directly tied to a normal fitness plan (e.g., body fat percentage if the userâ€™s goal is unrealistic or has no standard approach).
